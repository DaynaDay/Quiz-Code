For this project I was tasked with creating an interactive quiz. It should have a start screen that prompts the user to press play and begin the quiz. It should then display the questions of which there are five in total. There is a timer on the quiz. For every right question the user has an increase in their time. For every wrong answer the user has 10 seconds taken from the time remaining.  After time runs out the user should then be taken to a post-game screen.

Functions such as event delegations and time intervals were used to target each specific function of the overall project.
